Producer-consumer 

1. Define constants:
   - SHARED_MEM_SIZE: the maximum number of lines that can be stored in shared memory
   - MAX_STRING_LENGTH: the maximum length of a line

2. Define a struct SharedMemory to represent the shared memory:
   - Declare a 2-dimensional array "lines" to store the lines
   - Declare an integer "current_lines" to keep track of the number of lines stored
   - Declare two semaphores "sem_writer" and "sem_reader" for synchronization

3. Define a function write_to_shared_memory(shared_memory) that represents the behavior of the writer process:
   - Generate a unique line for the current process using the process ID
   - Loop indefinitely:
     - Wait on the writer semaphore
     - Check if the shared memory is full (current_lines equals SHARED_MEM_SIZE):
       - If it is full, signal the reader semaphore and exit the loop
     - Copy the generated line to the next available index in the "lines" array
     - Increment "current_lines"
     - Signal the reader semaphore
     - Generate a random sleep time between 1 and 5 seconds
     - Sleep for the generated time

4. In the main function:
   - Create a shared memory segment using shm_open
   - Set the size of the shared memory segment using ftruncate
   - Map the shared memory segment into the address space of the process using mmap
   - Initialize the semaphores in the shared memory
   - Initialize "current_lines" to 0
   - Call the write_to_shared_memory function with the shared_memory struct
   - Unmap the shared memory segment using munmap
   - Unlink the shared memory segment using shm_unlink
   - Destroy the semaphores

5. Exit the program
