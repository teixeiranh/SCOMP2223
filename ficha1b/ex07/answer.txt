a)
    It is safe to use async-signal-safe functions.
    All the functions from stdio are not async-signal-safe.
    These functions must maintain a statically allocated data and, when used 
    can operate on inconsistent data.

b)
    
    Because POSIX.1 specifies write() as an async-signal-safe function, ie, 
    is safe to use in a signal handler. The reason for this is it writes directly
    to a file descriptor without using any internal buffers or data structures that
    could be corrupted by a signal.
