-ex08- cant make main() reach the return 0, need to kill the execution in the terminal with CTRL-C
     - problem solved with adding kill(getpid(), SIGUSR1); after capturing sigusr1_handler
     - could have used exit(0) also

-ex12- The SA_NOCLDSTOP and SA_NOCLDWAIT flags are used to prevent the kernel 
       from automatically reaping the child processes when they exit or stop. 
       This allows the parent process to explicitly wait for them using wait().
       Is this information correct?
