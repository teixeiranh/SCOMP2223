a)
    The "CTRL-C" sends a SIGINT signal  to the process and kills it. In fact,
    the default action is to terminate the process. 

c)
    With CTRL-\ we use the terminal quit character, ie, SIGQUIT.
    In this case, by default, the signal terminates a process and causes it to 
    produce a core dump - which can then be used for debugging.
    Using SIGQUIT in this manner is good for a program that is stucked in an infinite
    loop.
