a) 
    The output of this code will be one of two possibilities, depending on the 
    process that runs first (parent or child). 
    If the first process that runs is the child, the output will be:
        1.x=2
        3.1234; x=0
        2.x=0
        3.(number bigger than 1234); x=0
    If the first process running is the parent process, the output will be:
        2.x=0
        3.(number bigger than 1234); x=0
        1.x=2
        3.1234; x=0

b)
    No, I am not. 
    Both processes are competing for the CPU time, running asynchronously 
    and concurrently and, in fact, I don't know which one will be processed first.
    If the child process runs first, I will see the following sequence: line 6-
    line 11 - line 9 - line 11. In this case, 11 appears first.
